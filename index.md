I am a principal applied scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS).  I am on a
leave of absence from the School of Computing at the University of Utah, where
I am an associate professor and I lead the Software Analysis Research
Laboratory ([SOARlab](http://soarlab.org)). My work aims to improve the
reliability and resilience of complex software systems by empowering developers
with practical tools and techniques for analysis of their artifacts.  To
achieve this, my research spans multiple areas, including formal verification,
programming languages, software engineering, and security.
